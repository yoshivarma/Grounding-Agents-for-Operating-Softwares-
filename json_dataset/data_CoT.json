In Step 1, click on Lists, then click on Accounting and then click on Items, so Step 1 can be re-written as : click[Lists], click[Accounting], click[Items]. In Step 2, the action verb is ‘select’ and the entity on which the action needs to be performed is ‘item’, hence we can convert it into select[item].  In Step 3, the action verb is ‘click’ and the entity on which the action needs to be performed is ‘View’, hence we can convert it into click[View]. So the answer is: Step 1: click[Lists], click[Accounting], click[Items]. Step 2: select[item]. Step 3: click[View].",
